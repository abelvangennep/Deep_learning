        "This notebook is hosted on Google Colab. To be able to work on it, you have to create your own copy. Go to *File* and select *Save a copy in Drive*.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is vary valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",

        "```sh\n",
        "!nvidia-smi\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected. "

The matrix is symmetric if the edges are undirected. adding $I_n$, will give a small change, because now the Adjendancy matrix also place's a one at all edges (i,i). This could be interpreted as self connections.\n",

Taking $\\tilde{D}^{-1/2}$ is an operation, which can be (due to diagonal matrix properties) be performed element wise on every element on the diagonal. $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times c}$ is the matrix, which summarices the features (c) of every node (n). \n",

Next we want to use additional information, which are represented in the features. If we would not backpropogate this information it would not be included in the model, therefor we want to backpropogate the feature values, using this normalization term. So that node x includes some portion of the information of their neighbours.

        "We speak about semi-supervised learning if the data is only partially labelled. In this specific example \"data.y\" includes all labels, but we don't use all labels. The model is fed with a complete graph of 2708 nodes, then we use only a few labels to make a prediction and back propogate the loss through the complete network \n",
        "\n",
        "We train the model on the complete data set with 2708 nodes, of these 2708 nodes we use only 5% of the data labels, this amount is really small and shows the power of the model as labelling data is a time expensive job. In other supervised benchmark task a lot more labelled data is fed to the machines as it increases understanding, there the goal is to maximize the amount of train data in such a way data the test and validation set are accurate enough to test the and tweek the model performances. But why this difference? A supervised model is trained to do prediction on new data let's say some unseen letteer in MNIST case, but the GCN's are build to predict labels in a network, if you build a network and you already feed it all the labels, why the go through all the trouble?\n",
        "\n",
        "GCN's are especially powerfull in semi-supervised settings, because it understands relation between labelled and unlabelled data. Where image classification only uses an input and weights, the GCNs have next to the input and weights knowledge about how neurons are connected. This leads to a better understanding of also unlabelled data.\n"

        "Finally we conclude with a small summary of the observations we found during training. In the first epoch we expect the accuracy to be close to the .50, because at every single observation we have a 50% chance of guessing correctly. This also holds when running the model. Next we see that we train on the data and we see that the model trains and quite quickly (approx. after 100 epochs) the accuracy stabalizes. Even after 5000 epochs the accuracy appears to be \"stuck\" in a local minimum. We clearly see that the model does not over fit even though it sees exactly the same data at every epoch. This can be found especially well when comparing the train accuracy, with that of the test and validation set."
